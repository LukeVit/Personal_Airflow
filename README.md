# Personal_Airflow
Personal project to learn about airflow and implement an simple ETL pattern with Spotify API

Airflow is a open source software which I have been seeing being talked about more and more. 

As an aspiring data engineer I have an interest in trying out new DE tools to improve my skills, learn new things and adopt relevent platforms.

Professionally I am current very much an Azure cloud data engineer, all my position so far have been with companies that a completely Azure partners, so open source platform like this are a good opportunities to learn new tools.

Upon reading further about airflow one thing that stands out to me is the flexibility of the tool, being able to completely design the pipeline within your chosen coding language, in my case python, your familiarity with langugae lends itself to design a wide range of ingestion and transformation patterns. 

Python really is a perfect language to pair with this tool since the wealth of librareis to work with data, connectors are available to every API you would want to work with and ORM for working databases.

As an additional piece I see that the configurations for the settings for airflow are quite important and alot of people deploy the pipelines in a Docker environment. Docker is also a relevant DE tool that sees alot of use a use as an alternative to VMs. So I will be using Docker environment to deploy this test project, hit two bird with one stone, learn another plaform.
